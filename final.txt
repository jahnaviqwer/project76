SPA uses AJAX technology. Thatâ€™s the set of techniques that allow  refreshing only a part of the 
app instead of the entire web app. SPA sends an AJAX request to the server, gets JSON data 
back from the server and renders certain parts of the web page directly in the browser.

Models, Views, and Controllers. This pattern helps to achieve separation of concerns. Using 

Models: Models are the objects used to retrieve and store the model state in the database.  
Let's see an example. 

View: View components show the User Interface (UI) of the applications that is created by the data model.

Controllers: In MVC, controllers are also called the components. These components manage the user interaction
 and chooses a view for displaying the UI. The main work of the controller is that it manages the query string 
values and transfers these values to the models.
